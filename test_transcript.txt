00:00:03 — Karen (HR Manager)

Good morning everyone, thanks for joining. Today's sync is to review engineering workload updates, onboarding improvements, and a few HR-program adjustments.

00:00:12 — David (Engineering Manager)

Morning everyone.

00:00:14 — Sam (Engineer)

Hi all.

00:00:16 — Lina (Designer)

Hello!

00:00:18 — Karen

Let's begin with the onboarding experience review. We got feedback from the two new engineers who joined last month — they said the documentation helped but some parts of the setup instructions were outdated.

00:00:32 — David

Yeah, I heard the same. Some configuration steps changed after the last backend update.

00:00:40 — Karen

Okay.
Sam, can you update the development environment setup guide by Thursday?

00:00:46 — Sam

Yes, I'll handle that. Shouldn't take long.

00:00:50 — Karen

Next point: the UI handoff workflow. Some teams mentioned delays in receiving design specs last sprint.

00:00:58 — Lina (Designer)

Yes, that happened because we switched to Figma components and were reorganizing files. Everything is sorted now.

00:01:10 — Karen

Perfect.
Lina, please upload the finalized component library to the shared design folder today.

00:01:17 — Lina

Sure, I'll do that after this call.

00:01:20 — David

On the engineering side, we're planning to start the new Release Notes Automation Tool next week. But before that, we need the list of all APIs currently being used.

00:01:32 — Sam

Right. I have half the list ready.

00:01:36 — David

Great.
Sam, please complete the full API usage list and send it to me by Monday.

00:01:43 — Sam

Got it.

00:01:46 — Karen

Another item from HR: the company is preparing for the quarterly training cycle. We need engineering to confirm which topics the team wants.

00:01:56 — David

Yeah, last time the team asked for stress-testing workshops and backend microservices updates.

00:02:04 — Karen

Okay.
David, can you compile the training topic preferences from your team by Friday?

00:02:10 — David

Sure, I'll gather the responses.

00:02:14 — Lina

One thing from design: I want to align with engineering about the new dashboard color scales.

00:02:20 — David

Yes, let's sync on that.

00:02:22 — Karen

We can make it an action item.
Lina and David, schedule a design–engineering alignment meeting for next Tuesday.

00:02:30 — Lina

Will do.

00:02:31 — David

I'll block a slot.

00:02:33 — Karen

Before we close, last item: performance review cycle reminders go out next week.
Everyone, please review your self-assessment drafts before Monday.

00:02:45 — Sam

Noted.

00:02:46 — Lina

Okay.

00:02:47 — David

Will do.

00:02:49 — Karen

That covers everything. Thanks for joining and have a productive day.

00:02:53 — Lina

Thank you!

00:02:54 — Sam

Bye.

00:02:56 — David

See you all.
