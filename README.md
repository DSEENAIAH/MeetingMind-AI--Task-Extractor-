## 💡 Why did we build this?

We noticed a critical gap in the workflow of productive teams: **The "Post-Meeting Slump."**

Great ideas and action items often get lost in long transcripts or messy notepads. Manually identifying tasks, assigning them to the right people, and setting due dates is:

*   ⏳ **Time-consuming**
*   ❌ **Prone to human error**
*   🛑 **A disruption to creative flow**

We built MeetingMind AI to **automate the administrative burden**, allowing teams to focus on *doing* the work, not just *managing* it.
